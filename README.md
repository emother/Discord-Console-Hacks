We have a Discord Server: __(not available rn*)__ (2nd server)

Currently all my IP Adresses (all exit nodes, I2P (darknet) outproxies, VPN's and proxies) are blacklisted and I can't create any accounts. Allthough I expclicitly put a disclaimer above any code published, Discord is going after me, which makes it... more... difficult to create new accounts...
Please don't use console hacks not sent by me, or you might risk loosing your account.
I'll update this invite regularly, if e.g. my account gets compromised or Discord shuts down the Server, I will create a new Account, a new Server and will then update the invite above.
If the invite doesn't work anymore, it means the Server got deleted and you need to wait until I can create a new Account.
